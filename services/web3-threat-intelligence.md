# üîê Web3 Threat Intelligence
**Why is Web3 threat intelligence important?**

Web3 threat intelligence is important because it helps organizations and individuals to proactively identify, assess, and mitigate potential cyber threats and attacks on Web3 applications and services. Web3 threat intelligence involves collecting, analyzing, and sharing information about the latest cyber threats, attack techniques, and vulnerabilities in the Web3 ecosystem, and using this information to enhance the security and resilience of Web3 systems.

Thanks to D-HPC, which was revealed by the system sources of tens of thousands of participants, billions of devices and hosts connected to the Internet will be periodically scanned and threat intelligence will be realized in a very short time. 

The following advantages are targeted thanks to the Web3 threat intelligence obtained through Distributed High Power Computing (D-HPC);

1. Early detection of threats: Web3 threat intelligence helps organizations and individuals to identify potential threats and attacks before they happen. By monitoring and analyzing the latest trends and patterns in Web3 cyber threats, threat intelligence teams can identify indicators of compromise and potential attack vectors, and take appropriate measures to prevent or mitigate the impact of an attack.

2. Risk assessment and prioritization: Web3 threat intelligence enables organizations and individuals to assess the risk and potential impact of cyber threats on their Web3 assets and services. By prioritizing the most critical assets and vulnerabilities, organizations can focus their resources and efforts on the areas that pose the highest risk and mitigate potential damage.

3. Proactive defense and mitigation: Web3 threat intelligence allows organizations and individuals to proactively defend against cyber threats and attacks, by implementing appropriate security measures, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, or penetration testing. By staying ahead of the attackers, organizations can minimize the impact of an attack and reduce the likelihood of a successful breach.

4. Collaborative response and information sharing: Web3 threat intelligence facilitates collaboration and information sharing among different stakeholders in the Web3 ecosystem, including developers, security researchers, and regulatory agencies. By sharing threat intelligence data and insights, stakeholders can work together to identify and address emerging threats, develop best practices and standards, and promote the overall security and resilience of Web3 systems.

In summary, Web3 threat intelligence plays a critical role in protecting Web3 applications and services from cyber threats and attacks, by enabling organizations and individuals to detect, assess, and mitigate potential risks and vulnerabilities. By leveraging the latest threat intelligence data and insights, stakeholders can stay ahead of the attackers and ensure the continued security and success of the Web3 ecosystem.
