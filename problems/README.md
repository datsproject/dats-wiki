# PROBLEMS
> [!NOTE]
> The cyber security services you purchase request some information from you. Hackers, on the other hand, do not demand anything from you.

**Problems:**

1. Additional cyber risks to be created by over 75 billion devices based on Internet of things that are estimated to be utilized worldwide as of 2025.
2. Dependency on gray service in DDOS test product.
3. High Power Computing: High investment and maintenance cost.
4. While institutions need a whitelist for the penetration testing services they purchase, the hackers can achieve their goals without the need for a whitelist.
5. The risks of cyber security increasing day by day.
6. Inability of countries to provide good cyber border security due to insufficient Computing Power.
7. We will offer you the opportunity to experience being one step ahead of cybercriminals with the high computing power required by the cyber security industry.
8. The fact that vulnerability search engines cannot provide the most up to date information due to limited resources.

**Why aren't more people adopting Web3 dApps?**

It has been observed that hackers are able to bypass existing security products by attacking information systems from thousands of botnet sources. In addition, the perception of many teams in the Web3 space that security only consists of smart contract security and auditing allows many hacking events to occur easily. Therefore, the most important way to deal with hackers is to detect security vulnerabilities and close vulnerabilities before they are exploited, thanks to decentralized and high computing power automated pentest products. Through cryptocurrency attacks, the cybercriminal community amassed $4.25 billion last year, nearly three times the $1.49 billion in crypto assets looted in 2020. According to statistics gathered by Comparitech, six of the top ten most expensive crypto breaches occurred in 2021. Another survey revealed that exploiting decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols was the fastest-growing way to steal crypto in 2021. DeFi is responsible for $1.4 billion of the overall crypto money lost alone in the previous year. The report stated that the technology is nascent, hence featuring many vulnerabilities that hackers routinely exploit.
