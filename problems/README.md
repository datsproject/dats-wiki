# PROBLEMS
> [!NOTE]
> The cyber security services you purchase request some information from you. Hackers, on the other hand, do not demand anything from you.

**Problems:**

1. Additional cyber risks to be created by over 75 billion devices based on Internet of things that are estimated to be utilized worldwide as of 2025.
2. Dependency on gray service in DDOS test product.
3. High Power Computing: High investment and maintenance cost.
4. While institutions need a whitelist for the penetration testing services they purchase, the hackers can achieve their goals without the need for a whitelist.
5. The risks of cyber security increasing day by day.
6. Inability of countries to provide good cyber border security due to insufficient Computing Power.
7. We will offer you the opportunity to experience being one step ahead of cybercriminals with the high computing power required by the cyber security industry.
8. The fact that vulnerability search engines cannot provide the most up to date information due to limited resources.
