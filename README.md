## Overview
Postmodern Web3 Security Infrastructure Paradigm!

> [!NOTE]
> Postmodern Web3 Security Infrastructure paradigm represents a shift towards a decentralized, collaborative, and multi-layered approach to security, which is different from traditional security approaches.

**Web3 Security issue is preventing the Web3 ecosystem from growing.**

Web3 security is threatening the future of blockchain technology, the vision offered by Web3, and the adoption of DApps by more people. Although DApps with different usage areas are developed every day, we cannot ensure the development and growth of Web3 unless we can solve the security problem.
